    Minik is a microframwork that will handle a request from the API gateway and it
    will return a valid http response. The response returned will be determined by
    the view associated with a given route. If the route has a set of path parameters
    the parameters will be given to the view during execution. The view itself will
    have access to the current requests and all it's original data values.

    Very similar to Flask or Chalice, to associate a route to a view use an instance
    of minik to decorate the function:
